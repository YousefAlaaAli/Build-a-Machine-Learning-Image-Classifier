# Build-a-Machine-Learning-Image-Classifier
Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning image classifier using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images into different categories using TensorFlow and OpenCV.

Features
Preprocessing images using OpenCV.
Training a deep learning model using TensorFlow.
Visualizing model performance using Matplotlib.
Handling potential warnings for a cleaner workflow.

Technologies Used
NumPy (numpy): For numerical operations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib (matplotlib): For visualizing training results.
TensorFlow (tensorflow): For building and training the neural network.
OpenCV (cv2): For image preprocessing.
Warnings (warnings): To manage warning messages.
