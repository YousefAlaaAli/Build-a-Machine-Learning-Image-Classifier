# Build-a-Machine-Learning-Image-Classifier

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify images using deep learning techniques. The model processes image data, trains a neural network, and evaluates its performance to ensure high accuracy in classification tasks.

## Objectives
- **Image Preprocessing**: Convert images into numerical format and normalize pixel values for better model performance.
- **Model Training**: Utilize TensorFlow to build and train a deep learning model for image classification.
- **Evaluation & Visualization**: Assess model accuracy and visualize results using Matplotlib.
- **Optimization**: Improve model performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images belonging to different categories. These images are processed and fed into a neural network for classification.

## Expected Outcomes
- A trained deep learning model capable of classifying images with high accuracy.
- Insights into model performance through evaluation metrics and visualization.
- Future improvements such as data augmentation and transfer learning.

## How to Use
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data and train the model.
3. Evaluate the model performance using test images.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing **data augmentation** for better generalization.
- Using **transfer learning** to improve accuracy with pre-trained models.
- Deploying the model as a web or mobile application.
